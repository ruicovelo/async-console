# Async-Console

I'm really not sure about the name...


This is my first curses experiment. It's a console application
composed by two curses windows: one for displaying text and
another for receiving keyboard input.

The goal is to be able to display asynchronous output from
processes running in the background without interfering with
the input. 

I tried to find something like this - I thought this was a
common problem and someone would already have solved - but
couldn't find anything like ti. So I coded my own.

I need this for MyBot project where I spawn multiple modules in
different processes and want to receive their text output while
I type in new commands.

If you know anything like this please tell me. I rather be
coding something else. It's nice to finally use curses in one of
my projects thou...
